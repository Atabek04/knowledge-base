# Atomic Note Creation Rules

Follow this reference exactly when the user asks to create notes for a concept introduced during coaching.

---

## Pre-Creation Checklist

Before writing any note:

- [ ] Does the concept have a named framework (e.g. "Implementation Intentions") — not just a general idea?
- [ ] Does the user want a note for this specific concept, or just understanding?
- [ ] Is there already an existing note for this concept in the vault? (Search `02-Zettelkasten/` first)
- [ ] Which MOC chapter does it belong to?

---

## File Location

```
02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/{Subtopic}/
```

Subtopic folders map to MOC chapters:

| MOC Chapter | Subfolder |
|---|---|
| Habits | `02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/Habits/` |
| Discipline & Willpower | `02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/Discipline/` |
| Time Management | `02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/Time-Management/` |
| Study Techniques | `02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/Study-Techniques/` |
| Mindset & Mental Models | `02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/Mindset/` |
| Principles from Books | `02-Zettelkasten/Self-Mastery/Books/` |

Create the subfolder if it doesn't exist.

## Note Title Rules

Titles must be **complete statements** — not topic labels.

❌ Bad: "Implementation Intentions", "Planning Fallacy", "Non-Zero Day"
✓ Good: "Implementation intentions convert vague goals into automatic if-then triggers"
✓ Good: "Planning Fallacy causes people to underestimate task duration even with past evidence"

Test: Does the title teach something on its own, or just name a thing?

---

## Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
title: {full atomic title as complete statement}
aliases: [{short recognizable name people would search for}]
tags: [self-mastery, {subtopic}]
---
```

**Alias rules:**
- Short, plain text only — no symbols (`?.`, `::`, etc.)
- Use the name people would search for (e.g. `Implementation Intentions`, `Planning Fallacy`)
- Can have multiple: `[Implementation Intentions, if-then planning, Gollwitzer]`

---

## Note Body Structure

```markdown
{Opening paragraph — explain the concept in 1-3 sentences, plain language. No heading needed.}

### Why it matters

{Why this concept is significant. One concrete consequence of not knowing it.}

---

### How it works

{The mechanism. Use an analogy. Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences each.}

---

### Research backing

{Author, year, key finding. One real stat if available. If uncertain, write "Research suggests..." — never fabricate.}

---

### How to apply it

{Concrete implementation. IF-THEN, checklist, example, or formula. Make it actionable.}

---

### Read more

- [[{related note full title}]]
- [[{MOC full title}]]
```

**Formatting rules:**
- Use `###` and `####` only — never `#` or `##` (too large)
- Horizontal lines `---` between major sections
- Start directly with content — no "Parent: [[MOC]]" header at top
- Short paragraphs: 1-3 sentences max. Single-sentence paragraphs are fine.
- MOC link and related notes go in "Read more" only, not at the top

---

## Linking Rules

### Inline links
Use when the note title fits naturally in a sentence. Use aliases to keep it smooth:
`[[Implementation intentions convert vague goals into automatic if-then triggers|Implementation Intentions]]`

### Read more section
- Every note created must link back to `[[Self-Mastery MOC]]`
- Link to any strongly related existing notes found in the vault
- List all inline links here again (full title, no aliases)
- Add additional related notes that didn't fit inline

### Finding related notes
Search `02-Zettelkasten/` for notes that:
- Are in the same MOC chapter
- Reference the same researcher or framework
- Address the same struggle type (e.g. all "behavioral domain" notes)

---

## MOC Update

After creating the note, add it to `01-MOCs/Self-Mastery/Self-Mastery MOC.md` under the correct chapter.

Format to use:
```markdown
- [[{full note title}|{short alias}]] — {one-line description}
```

Example:
```markdown
- [[Implementation intentions convert vague goals into automatic if-then triggers|Implementation Intentions]] — IF-THEN plans that pre-load execution so action becomes automatic
```

---

## Flashcard Creation (Only If User Asks)

Location: `05-Flashcards/Self-Mastery/{subtopic}.md`
One file per subtopic area.

Rules:
- Only create flashcards for the note just written — not general knowledge
- Every key concept, definition, formula, and example should become a card
- Follow the syntax in `04-Docs/Rules/FLASHCARD_SYNTAX.md`
- Use `START/END` block format
- After creation, tell the user to strip IDs before syncing with Anki (point to `scripts/remove-flashcard-ids.sh`)

---

## Quality Checklist Before Finishing

- [ ] Title is a complete statement (teaches something alone)
- [ ] Aliases are plain text, no symbols
- [ ] Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences
- [ ] No `#` or `##` headings
- [ ] Horizontal lines between sections
- [ ] Note starts with content, not a MOC link
- [ ] "Read more" section present with MOC link
- [ ] Note added to correct MOC chapter
- [ ] At least one link to an existing note (no orphans)
